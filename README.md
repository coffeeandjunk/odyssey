Odyssey
========

Odyssey is a Solar System visualizer written in Javscript and WebGl for my class project on teaching children about the structure of the Solar System and the various events like Seasons of Earth, Phases of Moon etc. It is still WIP and I plan to make it multilingual. This space will be updated with more details as the work progresses. Thanks for dropping by. And yes, I have taken help from various sources and I'll update the list soon. I do plan to document the code as the work progresses.
