Odyssey
========

Odyssey is a Solar System visualizer written on top of the popular 'jsorrery' for my class project on teaching children about the Solar System. It is still WIP. I plan to integrate Leap Motion into it and add a whole bunch of other cool interactions too. This page will be updated with more details as the work progresses. Thanks for dropping by. And yes, I do plan to document the code as the work progresses.
